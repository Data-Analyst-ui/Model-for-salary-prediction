# 📊 Salary Prediction Model
This project presents a machine learning model designed to estimate or predict salary ranges for different job titles based on historical data and job-related factors. The goal is to provide salary insights that can help job seekers, HR professionals, and businesses make informed compensation decisions.

## 🚀 Project Overview
Salary estimation is crucial for career planning and recruitment. This model leverages statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to predict salary ranges based on variables such as:
✔ Job Title – Determines the expected salary for different roles.
✔ Industry – Shows variations across different sectors.
✔ Experience Level – Captures how salaries increase with seniority.
✔ Location – Accounts for regional salary differences.
✔ Skills & Education  – Highlights the impact of qualifications.

By analyzing these factors, the model provides a data-driven salary range estimate, helping users understand compensation expectations for various job positions.

# 🔎 Key Features
✅ Data Preprocessing & Cleaning – Handles missing values, standardizes formats, and ensures data consistency.
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Generates insights using visualizations such as boxplots, histograms, and heatmaps.
✅ Machine Learning Model – Implements regression algorithms for salary prediction.
✅ Evaluation Metrics – Uses RMSE, MAE, and R² to assess model performance.
✅ Visualization & Insights – Displays salary distributions, trends, and influential factors.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python ( R, Stata,)
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost.
Model Type: Linear Regression, Random Forest.

## 📈 Insights & Findings
📍 Higher experience levels lead to exponential salary growth.
📍 Certain industries offer significantly higher compensation than others.
